The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films,
independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

The franchise includes comic books, short films, television series, and digital series. The shared universe, much like the original
Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.
